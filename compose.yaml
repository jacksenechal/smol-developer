# A Docker Compose file for running the app in a container
# Run with `docker-compose run --rm dev`

# Requirements:
# - use the dockerfile at .devcontainer/dockerfile to build and run a service called 'dev'
# - mount the current directory as /app
# - do not expose any ports
# - drop the user into a bash shell when the container starts

# Solution:

services:
  dev:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: .devcontainer/dockerfile
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    entrypoint: bash
    user: app
